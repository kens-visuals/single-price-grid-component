## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Initially when I statrted the project my only goal was to make it as close to the design as possible and finish the project in the same day. I achieved both of the goals and since I had a lot of time left unntil the end of the day, I decied to add some more challenges for me. So the challenge was to make the entire layout without media queires, yap you red that right, **WITH NO MEDIA QUERIES**.Perhaps the coolest part of `CSS Grid` is that, if you use them correctly you can make your layout responsive. That small snippet of code, at the bottom of these text, takes care of the respnsiveness of the entire project. However, it would've been impossible without `clamp()`. This was my first time using `clamp()`, so I had to do a bit of research to see where and how I can use it.
I'll definetly use it in my future projects, perhaps not for `max-widht()`, but definetlyfor `font-size`. I might've abused the power of `clamp()`, but it all was for the sake of completing the project with no media queires whatsoever, just pushing the boundries üë®üèª‚Äçüíª This tiny project was one of the coolest project that I've done so far, and as you can tell I'm quite excited about it üòÖ

```css
.cube {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(30rem, 1fr));
}
```

### Continued development

Definetly will work with `CSS Grid` and try to push its boundries even further, and the same is also true for `clamp()`.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell's video of `clamp()`](https://youtu.be/U9VF-4euyRo) - The vide that helped me the most to get the grasp of `clamp()`.
- [Kevin Powell's video of `auto-fit` and `auto-fill`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjJR3qYCd54) - I refrenced one of my online lectures for this stuff, but Kevin, as always, does a great job of explaing `auto-fit` and `auto-fill`.
- [CSS Scan: `box-shadow`](https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples) - Thanks to this awesome collection of `box-shadow`s that help me every time.
- [CSS for People Who Hate CSS](https://paulcpederson.com/articles/css-for-people-who-hate-css/) - **MUST READ**. Really cool website that simpliy explains how to work more efficiently with CSS.
